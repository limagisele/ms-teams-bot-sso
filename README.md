# Teams Task Module

Bot Framework Teams Task Module sample.

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com). It shows how to fetch a Task Module from a Hero Card button and receive input from an Adaptive Card in the Task Module.

## Included Features
* Bots
* Tabs
* Task Modules

## Interaction with botss

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) latest version or equivalent tunnelling solution
- [Teams Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-cli?pivots=version-one)


## Setup

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```  

   Alternatively, you can also use the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

## Setup for bot
In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration).
    - For bot handle, make up a name.
    - Select "Use existing app registration" (Create the app registration in Azure Active Directory beforehand.)
    - __*If you don't have an Azure account*__ create an [Azure free account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
    
   In the new Azure Bot resource in the Portal, 
    - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
    - In Settings/Configuration/Messaging endpoint, enter the current `https` URL you were given by running the tunneling application. Append with the path `/api/messages`

## Setup for code

1) Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2) Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the `<<MicrosoftAppId>>`, `<<MicrosoftAppPassword>>` from the Bot Framework registration. (Note the App Password is referred to as the "client secret" in the azure portal and you can always create a new client secret anytime.) `<<MicrosoftAppTenantId>>` will be the id for the tenant where application is registered.
- Set "MicrosoftAppType" in the `.env`. (**Allowed values are: MultiTenant(default), SingleTenant, UserAssignedMSI**)

- Replace `<<BaseUrl>>` in the `.env` as per your application like the ngrok forwarding url (ie `https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app`) after starting ngrok and if you are using dev tunnels, your URL will be like: https://12345.devtunnels.ms.

- Replace `<<MicrosoftAppId>>` and <<BaseUrl>> with your MicrosoftAppId and BaseUrl in the `.TaskModuleTab.js` file.

1) Run your bot at the command line:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

1) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the `appPackage` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `<<Valid-Domain>>` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app` and if you are using dev tunnels then your domain will be like: `12345.devtunnels.ms`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (In Teams Apps/Manage your apps click "Upload an app". Browse to and Open the .zip file. At the next dialog, click the Add button.)
    - Add the app in personal/groupchat/team scope (supported scopes)

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-task-module/nodejs/index.js#L45) line and put your debugger for local debug.

## Running the sample

> Note this `manifest.json` specified that the bot will be installed in "personal", "team" and "groupchat" scope which is why you immediately entered a one on one chat conversation with the bot. You can at mention the bot in a group chat or in a Channel in the Team you installed it in. Please refer to Teams documentation for more details.

You can interact with this bot by sending it a message. The bot will respond with an Adaptive Card with buttons which will display a Task Module when clicked. The Task Modules demonstrate retrieving input from a user, or displaying custom web page content.
